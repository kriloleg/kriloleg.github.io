This small section is all about long exposure photography (being it night or day) with some tips and my works (homework).

## Tips

1. Use a tripod
1. Purchae remote button release
1. Frame up first. (you can use high ISO just to check what should go into the frame before doing a lot of test photos)
1. Look for a motion (cars, cloud, water, lights)
1. Use ND-Filter (during sunny day)

## Homework

Like this photo for the lights around.
