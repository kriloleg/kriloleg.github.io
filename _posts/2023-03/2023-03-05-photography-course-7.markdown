So, this section is all about portraits. I was looking for some model to help me with this kind of work, but... it was hard to me to do. Instead of this, I used a tripod to make some self-portraits. It was a great experience because it's comfortable: no worries, no scheduling, a lot of retries and no rush.

## Main section

Here would be just a list of photos I like most of all (not all of them, but much). Would be great to back to them some time later, remembering this great time ;)

Some colorful photos of me, sitting full-size:

This is a good one looking somewhere at side.

Like this one. It has focus on the hand. Probably, later on I will do some post-processing and add some more tones here.

And, some a bit "naked" photo in order to understand how to make photo of body. Probably, I will have some additional set of photos which will be related to the body only. (And, I think, I would need to use some another lense for this. Let's see)

I like this one for the backlight and strict look

## Summary

- I do like a black&white photos
- Need to put background a bit more far for the portrait to have more blur for them
- Create self portraits from tripod is fun (but requires to make a lot of shots)
