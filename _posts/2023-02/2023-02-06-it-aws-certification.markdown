AWS Certification (2nd for that time). It was long, sometimes very boring, but some new information recevied. Keeping it here for the history.

Course was taken on Udemy platform right [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-step-by-step/learn/lecture/33242966?start=0#overview). I would say, it's good for the beginners, but if you are looking from some deeps, probably it has to be some different course or more experience on solving issues on practice.
