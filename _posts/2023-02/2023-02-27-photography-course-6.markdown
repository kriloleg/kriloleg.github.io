This section is fully related to the lenses, types, details of the usage.

- *Focal length* - distance between where light entering the lense (explicitely the point where it's getting into sharp image) to the sensor.
- *Field of view* - how much  you can see through your lens (how wide or narrow)
    - 50mm - middle focal length (more equal to the human eye see the world)
    - smaller == wider field of view, bigger == telephoto
    - wide lenses can start stretching an image around the edges
- *Depth of field* - how much is in focus
- *Aperture* - amount of light comming into camer
- Most lenses shoot their 'sharpest' between f/4 - f5.6
- Image stabilization is great for the sport and wildlife (+telephoto)
