White balance and colors

1. White & orane - warm and happy
2. Blue - cold and cooler

There is a Kelvin scale which affects colors on camer (can be configured manually on camera)

- Overcast (6500)
- Daiylight/Sun (5700)
- Fluorescent (4000)
- Tungsten bulbs (3200)
- Candle light (1800)

# TIP: Picture profiles

Works with adding custom/predefined contrast, sharpness, etc.

- Auto: best fit for the situation
- Standard: closer to the standard color schema
- Portrait: less sharper background
- Landscap: more sharper
- Neutral: for editing
- Monochrome: shoot in black and white

# TIP: Color theory

- Very short range of visible range for the people eye
- There more we pay attention to the colors in the frame the more dynamic range we can get

1. Hue - position of colors on the color wheel
2. Color value - ligthness or darkness of a color
3. Color saturation - strength or weakness of a color
4. Complementary colors - are oposite colors (like red and green)

**Shooting in black and white**

1. Helps to focus on the 'what is on the photo' instead of the colors
2. Helps (in the mode) to pay attention to the exposure, whites/dards, shadows
3. Digital noise can be look fine on the black and white photos

# Practical task

Take a photo using color creatively:
- shoot a subject that contrasts with the background
- shoot a photo with only 1-2 colors in it
- shoot in black and white
