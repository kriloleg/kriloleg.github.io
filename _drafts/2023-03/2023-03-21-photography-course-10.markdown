This section holds several lessons described, practiced as sport photography

# Sport photography

## Tips

1. Use a 'long' lens to get closer
2. Increase the shutter speed
3. Take lots of photots
4. Postion yourself
5. Capture their faces (instead of backs)

## Additional tips

1. You can use manual focus (by calculating distance) if auto-focus can't handle it
2. Experiment with shutter speed to find the right one if you are trying to get blured background
3. You can use your flash (helps to freeze your subject in the frame)
4. Pay attention to composition
5. Shoot from a low angle, such as your knees and use a monopod

## Practice

Using the tips in this section, shoot your own action photo. The photo could capture the moving subject perfectly sharp, or you can try to get a blurred background using our panning method.

**// TODO (freeze action && blured background). Need Kostya for this or make some skateboarders photos, or Solomia on her bike**

## Macro photography

When the object you are photographing appears larger on the camera sensor than in real life. Requires specific lens.

## Tips

1. Use a macro lens
2. Choose a point of focus
3. Use a flash
4. Use a tripod
5. Move backward and forward to focus

**//TODO Using the tips in this section, shoot your own macro photo. Post your favorite photo(s) to this assignment. Try to photo some small objects (coins)**

Ideas for photo: flowers, water drops, insects, spiders, food, household objects.
