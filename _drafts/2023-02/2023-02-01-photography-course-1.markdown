Початок курсу по фотографії, зйомці. 28 годин лише лекційного матеріалу. Але варто крім того всього ще і зробити декілька практик. Це може бути на довго. Головне нагадувати собі, що я нікуди не спішу і насолоджуватися процесом. 

(Ноутс - до першого відео є гарний документ-вижимка і його можна завантажити і на нього опиратися для деталей)

Також, є група в ФБ від курсу де можна щось підчерпунти для себе: https://www.facebook.com/groups/thephotographymasterclass/

## Exposure Triangle

### Aperture

Exposure - how dark or bright your photo. Underexposed (dark), Overexposed (bright).

Controlled by triangle:

- Aperture (IRIS) - more or less light, depends on the hole in camera. F-Stop or F-Number. The smaller F-Number - the bigger aperture. Also, it affects *depth of field*.

### Shutter speed

How long camera is openned to get more/less light. To dark - make slover, taka photo of action (sport) - make it faster if you don't want to have a blur.

1/80 or 1/100 - poroposed configuration to avoid camera shake for the beginners. (and or use tripod)

### ISO

ISO - level of the sensitivity of your camera when light hits the sensor. Digital way to decrease/increase exposure.

Drawbacks - digital noise. Recomended not to go over 1600.

Base ISO - lowest ISO setting for the camera (base for more cameras is 100) to get the highest photo quality.

It has to be the last option (start with apparture and shutter speed.)

# Practice

3 different location with different lights and make 3 different photos with the right exposure.

Ideas:

- Somewhere inside (cafe) to strugle with lighting
- Some action (sport) to catch some action
- Somewhere outside (where would be enough of ligth, probably)

Result:

Evening photo, low light, no much of movement:

Early morning photo, very active movement and trying to catch some good moment:

Middle of the day, outisde, a bit cloudy weather

# Tips

- Use exposure meter in camera to achieve proper exposure (it has to be 0)
- Light meter is not always right. It's also depends on the photo you want to take. It's more a tool and you are using it as an artist to achieve the view you want

# ADVANCED: Metering modes

1. Matrix metering - read exposure from the whole matrix. General exposure
1. Spot metering - exposure from the single point you are focusing. Is a good for some photos like photos of moon (some contrasting), black dog on the snow
1. Center-weighted - from the center and some space around. Your subject should be really in the center

# ADVANCED:  Exposure compensation

Adjusting exposure can be done in some automatic modes to add more light or darkness. It's based on the (shutter speed, aperture, iso)

- Aperture priority --> changes shutter speed
- Shutter priority --> changes the aperture
- Program mode --> changes shutter speed

# Modes

1. Auto mode (A+) - camera will try to decide without you all the configurations. Great to get some good generally-exposed photos, but you can get high ISO and not very good quality photo
1. Program mode (P) - set shutter and aperture (adjust them)
1. Aperture priority (Av) - when you know what depth of field you want. Camera selects shutter speed
1. Shutter priority (Tv/Sp) - camera selects aperture. Good for the sport, freezing some action
1. Manual mode (M) - user selects everything for the photo he takes.

## Homework

Personally tried it one more time (it's not yet some deep knowledge inside me, but it's getting better for the time when and what you need. Somewhere to catch some action, and somewhere to bring this depth of field). My cat - model ;)

This is shutter speed mode (could catch an action, but there is a price in ISO)

And this one is aperture priority mode (cat was preaty steady, so I could keep ISO pretty low here)
