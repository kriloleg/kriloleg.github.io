Продовження курсу навчання по фотографії. Після першого асайменту. Ця частина буде в більшості про композицію в фоторафії.

**Composition** - what is in your photo-frame. Creating some creactive photos.

# Rules of compostion

- Rule of thirds (RoT) - setting your subject to the left or the right of the frame. Also good for horizonts, put it to the bottom line.
- Golden Ration (Fibonacci Spiral) - helps to product more complex and interesting photos in some cases. (doesn't mean it's better)

# Negative space

Compositional style. Photographing a subject without a lot of distractions (usually small in frame)

> TODO: need to do some small practice for this

# Leading lise

Composition technique. Lines, which we actually seeing in the photo. (some lines on the road, road itself, bridges, windows, shadows, etc)

Composition is to make lines lead to something/someone. Goal, is to direct viewer attention to the subject (it can be also windows, doors as well. Shooting through these frames)

# Balance & Symmetry

Balance - levels of horizonts, size and number of objects. Still different sizes can bring more to express by photo.

Symmetry - a photo, where the top & bottom or left & right sides are visually similar.

# Practice 1

Using the same subject (it could be a person, pet, or anything), compose them in 3 different ways. (3 of the list below)

- **Rule of third**
- Symmetry
- Golden ratio
- **Negative space**
- **Leading lines**

My three photos (compressed, without any editing on top)

Lading lines (and rule of thirds in action)

Just rule of third (it's hard to find some nice or interesting background indoor)

Negative space (this style is really interesting. Would be great to take some shot as this outdoor at some beach)

Also, from my feelings, would be really great to have some photo done with a reflection to create some symmetry.
