So... it has happened again. I'm back to this book, for this journey, actually, as it is going to take some long time together with theory and practice.  Excited and full of interested to get hands dirty. (as I can recollect, book is well structured and full of examples)

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers to learn from data.
